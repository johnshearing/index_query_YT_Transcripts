This project was just an experiment to get familiar with Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG).  

If you are interested in the topic the I recommend LightRAG and VideoRAG GitHub repositories.  
https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG

If you want to experiment with these scripts then use the scripts in order.  
Notes about how to use each script are in comments at the top of each script.  
Also, read the notes file for lots of useful commands.
